    let otherSpecialNumber = specialNumber;

    // Let's say we have an array
    let players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    let team = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = "Doug";

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(`Original array: ${players}`);
    console.log(`Copy of array: ${team}`);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    let teamSlice = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let teamConcat = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let teamEs6Spread = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    teamSlice[3] = "Bobby";
    teamConcat[3] = "Garfield";
    teamEs6Spread[3] = "Nimoy";

    console.log(`New copy of array (made with concat()): ${teamConcat}`);
    console.log(`New copy of array (made with ... operator): ${teamEs6Spread}`);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    let person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    let myMan = person;
    myMan.name = "Wes-dogg";

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    let tutor = Object.assign({}, person);
    tutor.name = "Wesley Bosley";

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    let futureMan = {...person};
    futureMan.name = "Wez Boz";

    console.log(`Original object: %o`, person);
    console.log(`New copy of object (made stupidly): %o`, myMan);
    console.log(`New copy of object (made with assign()): %o`, tutor);
    console.log(`New copy of object (made with {...}): %o`, futureMan);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    console.log(`
      Extra credit! The object spread operator was introduced in ES2018 and enjoys
      browser support across the board today... but according to MDN, it is still
      "experimental." I take this to mean that it could change at any moment, and
      that the proposal hasn't been finalized or approved.
